  Tulips are popular, early spring-blooming perennial bulbs in the lily family (Liliaceae), native to Central Asia and famously cultivated in the Netherlands. Known for their cup-shaped, brightly colored, and symmetrical flowers, they thrive in sunny spots with well-drained soil. These flowers, available in nearly every color except true blue, symbolize love, rebirth, and elegance.
